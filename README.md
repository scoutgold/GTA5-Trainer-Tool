# 🚀 Ultimate Guide to Downloading & Using GTA 5 Mod Menus (2025 Edition)  

Welcome to the **ultimate resource** for Grand Theft Auto V modding! Whether you're looking to enhance your gameplay with new features or just want to have some fun in Los Santos, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know about **GTA 5 Mod Menus**—from installation to advanced usage.

## 🔍 What Is a GTA 5 Mod Menu?  
A **mod menu** is an external tool that allows players to modify GTA V’s gameplay mechanics dynamically. With these menus, you can unlock hidden features, spawn vehicles instantly, manipulate game physics, or even troll your friends online (*use responsibly!*).  

### ✨ Popular Features:  
- **Unlimited Money & RP** – Skip the grind!  
- **Vehicle Spawner** – Summon any car or aircraft instantly.  
- **Player Customization** – Change your character’s stats/appearance on-the-fly.  
- **God Mode & Teleportation** – Become invincible or fast-travel across San Andreas!

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer  
Modding *can* violate Rockstar’s Terms of Service if used in multiplayer (**GTA Online**). We recommend using mod menus exclusively in **Story Mode/Single Player**. Proceed at your own risk—always back up your saves!

## 📥 How to Download & Install GTA 5 Mod Menus (Windows)  

### ✅ Prerequisites:  
- A legal copy of **GTA V (2025 Update)** installed on PC ([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) / [Epic Games](https://www.epicgames.com/store/)).  
- Latest version of **[Script Hook V](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/)** (required for most mods).  
- Antivirus temporarily disabled (*many mod tools trigger false positives*).  

### 🛠 Step-by-Step Installation:

[![DOWNLOAD NOW](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-GTA_Mod_Menu_(2025)-brightgreen)](https://app.mediafire.com/hyewxkvve9m42)  

2️⃣ **Extract Files**: Use WinRAR or 7-Zip to unpack the downloaded `.zip` into `GTA V\scripts`. Create this folder if it doesn’t exist!  

3️⃣ **Run Script Hook V**: Launch `ScriptHookV.dll` *before* starting GTA V (or drop it into the game’s root folder).  

4️⃣ **Launch GTA V**: Start the game normally—your mod menu should auto-inject! Default activation key is usually `F4` or `~`.

## 🎮 Using Your Mod Menu Like a Pro  
Once injected, navigate options with arrow keys + enter key (*varies by menu*). Here are common controls:  

| Key Combo | Action | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `↑↓←→`    | Browse options | Select "Vehicle Spawner" |
| `Enter`   | Confirm choice | Spawn an Oppressor Mk II |
| `Backspace` | Return to previous menu | Exit submenu |

💡 **Tip:** Many menus support customization via `.ini` files—edit these to rebind hotkeys!
